A VERY simple game
In this game you are a kitty that wants to explore the world. This game was created in python and ported into html (for demo). 
This is a text based game! It has some features but not too much. I want to expand this game in the future.
The web version is just clicking buttons and diffrent things will happen. The python version you select numbers and diffrent things will happen...
Thats it!
